# A
We can use **stacks** to simulate the stacking of chess pieces,so the problem will become simpler.But my code implementation is a bit ugly,it can be further streamlined.

# B

# C

# D

# E

# F

# G

# H

# I

# J

# k
**Cannot produce the same number consecutively!**

If A uses $m$,then in the next round,as long as B uses $m - 1$,B will definitely not lose,and the same applies to B.Therefore,it is only possible to determine the winner in the first round,it's easy to find that answer is $ 1 / n $.
